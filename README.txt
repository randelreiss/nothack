convert this python 2 usage of sort to python 3:
def getPath(tileMap, startLocation, endLocation):
    searched = [ startLocation ]
    nodes = [ Node(tileMap, startLocation, None, searched, 0) ]
    node = None
    while nodes:
        node = nodes.pop(0)
        if node.isGoal(endLocation):
            break
        nodes.extend(node.expand())
        nodes.sort()
    path = [ node.location ]
    while(node.parent != None):
        path.append(node.parent.location)
        node = node.parent
    path.reverse()
    return path

Sure, here's the Python 3 version of the code with the changes:

python

def getPath(tileMap, startLocation, endLocation):
    searched = [startLocation]
    nodes = [Node(tileMap, startLocation, None, searched, 0)]
    node = None
    while nodes:
        node = nodes.pop(0)
        if node.isGoal(endLocation):
            break
        nodes.extend(node.expand())
        nodes.sort(key=lambda n: n.cost)  # sort by cost
    path = [node.location]
    while node.parent is not None:
        path.append(node.parent.location)
        node = node.parent
    path.reverse()
    return path

In Python 3, the sort() method does not return a new sorted list, but instead sorts the list in place. The key argument was added to sort() in Python 3, which allows specifying a function to extract a sort key from each element in the list. In this case, we're sorting the nodes list by the cost attribute of each Node object.

Also, in Python 3, we should use is not instead of != to compare an object to None.
